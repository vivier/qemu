Subject: [PATCH 140/140] usb-ehci: sanity-check iso xfers

This patch adds a sanity check to itd processing to make sure the
endpoint addressed by the guest is actually an iso endpoint.  Also
verify that usb drivers don't return USB_RET_ASYNC which is illegal for
iso xfers.

[qemu-kvm-1.0: we don't track ep types on RHEL-6 like we do upstream, so we
cannot check if an itd is pointing to a non iso ep in advance, but we do still
need to make sure that we never handle an iso xfer async. So check if the
device does want to handle it async, and if so cancel the xfer and treat it as
a NAK, like upstream does when the ep type check fails.]
